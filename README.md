# Overview
A very basic "Hello World" program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This program was written to demonstrate Python's built-in Tkinter library, which is used to create the GUI. It also served as a practice for the basic integration of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Python. 

A demonstration of the program is provided here: [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/w7FKQ6vG5fE)
