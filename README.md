# Overview
A very basic "Hello World" program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This program was written to demonstrate the integration of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Python. It also served as a practice for the basics of Python's built-in Tkinter library used to create the GUI.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
